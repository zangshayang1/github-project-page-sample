## Steps to make a STATIC github page for your project:
1. At the root directory of the master branch of your project, create a __docs__ directory. (You can find other ways of making the pages in repository settings. This is the way I prefer to structure my project.)
2. Now you are free to create files and dirs inside of __docs__. For example, all the pagefiles about module A goes into _"/docs/A"_. 
3. Worthnoting that you can use html files to render a page or use markdown files. The page is built by github backend engine, jekyll, I suppose. I prefer markdown files. Neat. 
4. If I have a _"/docs/first.md"_ file in my repository, you can visit _"zangshayang1.github.io/github-project-page-sample/first"_ to view it. If I have a _"/docs/index.md"_ file in my repository, you can visit _"zangshayang1.github.io/github-project-page-sample/"_ to view it. __You got the idea.__
5. If it doesn't show, give it some time. 


__Here are some bold sample links I suppose.__
